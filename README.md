Software Engineering

The Craft
---------

* [2] [Implementation Patterns] (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/781559.Implementation_Patterns) by Kent Beck {Broadly applicable, but the examples are all in Java. Those working in the Java 8+ world will find some (thankfully) outdated suggestions here.  Nevertheless, it serves well as a guide for Junior Developers. It should be very basic review for a competent Senior Developer.}

This should remain a good guide to some of the "Post Java 8" concepts. }


Kotlin
